# eCommerce Transactions

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing eCommerce transaction data to uncover insights related to customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. By applying techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and predictive modeling, the project helps businesses enhance decision-making and customer targeting.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze key metrics like sales volume, transaction frequency, and customer demographics.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Perform clustering to segment customers and understand different buying patterns.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Use models to predict future transactions and identify high-value customers.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
